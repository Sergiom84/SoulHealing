# SoulHealing

This project contains the mobile and web code for the "Rutina de Perd√≥n" application.

## Android build

The Android application requires a Firebase configuration file at `android/app/google-services.json`.
This file contains secrets and **is not** tracked in git.
Store it securely (for example, as a CI secret or on your build server) and
copy it to the above path before building or running the Android app.
